------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANCED LEVEL — Insight, Logic & Creativity
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Do players with more matches played tend to have higher goals? Prove this with a graph and correlation value.
2. Create a new column called "Goals per Match" and find which player has the best efficiency.
3. Which city has players with the highest average pass accuracy?

6. Do players who own a luxury car (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) perform better in goals or assists?
7. Find the team with the youngest average age.
8. Create a heatmap showing correlations between numerical columns — which pairs are most related?
9. Which position has the most consistent pass accuracy (lowest standard deviation)?
10.Create a short written report summarizing who the best overall player is and why.

------------------------------------------------------------
BONUS: DATA CLEANING & ENGINEERING CHALLENGES
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Rename "Pass Accuracy (%)” to "Pass_Accuracy".
2. Check for and handle any missing or null values.
3. Sort players alphabetically by "Team" and then by "Player Name".
4. Export a filtered Excel file containing only players with >5 goals and >3 assists.
5. Create a new column called "Total Cards" = "Yellow Cards" + "Red Cards".
6. Find which player has the highest number of cards and identify their team.
7. Normalize the "Goals" column (convert to percentage of total goals scored).
8. Filter players with "Pass_Accuracy" above the dataset average and plot them by team.
9. Create a pivot table showing average goals and assists per team.
10.Save your final cleaned dataset to a new file named cleaned_soccer_data.xlsx.
